# Sign-Up Form

Welcome to the Sign-Up Form repository! This project is currently a work in progress and is intended for practice purposes only. It showcases my skills in web layout and design, as well as my proficiency with form elements and built-in validation features.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes for a seamless user experience. (To be implemented
)
- **Form Elements**: Utilizes various input types, including text fields, checkboxes, and dropdowns.
- **Built-in Validation**: Implements HTML5 form validation to enhance user input accuracy and provide immediate feedback.

Feel free to explore the code and see how Iâ€™ve integrated these elements. Your feedback and contributions are welcome!
